Repo for the group with the following members:

Oran Murray
Hannes Kurzmann
Heiani Rey
Clément Adélaïde
Tshephang Komana
Zazie Aguilar

The repo contains two files of code which we have developped:

Steady-State_final.py- this deals with the first part of the report regarding the simulation of the room under steady-state conditions with no capacities
Step-response_final.py- this deals with the second part of the report regarding the step response of the room for a variation in outdoor temperature step

!IMPORTANT!- because of the number of time steps in the step-response code, the simulation takes a long time to run in binder (much longer than in the desktop IDE)

the dm4bem.py file required for the step response code is also included
